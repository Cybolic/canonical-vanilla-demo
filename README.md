# Canonical Blog Demo

This is a simple demo of the Vanilla framework from Canonical. It shows the preview cards for a few posts and not much else.
To match the *vanilla* spirit, no framework is used; instead, an extremely simple DOM renderer is included, slightly similar to mithril.js or React without JSX.

To get started, install the dependencies:
```
yarn install
```

And then run the development server:
```
yarn run serve
```

NOTE: The fixture data included in this repo is not under this project's license, it belongs to Canonical.
